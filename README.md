# Dialect Classification with Deep Learning

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17946246.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17946246)

**Duration:** 60-90 minutes
**Platform:** Google Colab or SageMaker Studio Lab
**Cost:** $0 (no AWS account needed)
**Data:** ~1.5GB speech/text dialect corpus

## Research Goal

Train a transformer-based deep learning model to automatically identify and classify dialects from speech and text data across multiple languages. Build a neural network that learns distinctive phonological, lexical, and syntactic patterns that characterize regional and social varieties.

## Quick Start

### Run in Google Colab
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/YOUR_USERNAME/research-jumpstart/blob/main/projects/linguistics/language-analysis/tier-0/dialect-classification.ipynb)

### Run in SageMaker Studio Lab
[![Open in SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/studiolab.svg)](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/import/github/YOUR_USERNAME/research-jumpstart/blob/main/projects/linguistics/language-analysis/tier-0/dialect-classification.ipynb)

## What You'll Build

1. **Download dialect corpus** (~1.5GB speech/text data, takes 15-20 min)
2. **Preprocess linguistic features** (phonetic transcription, tokenization)
3. **Train transformer classifier** (60-75 minutes on GPU)
4. **Evaluate accuracy** (F1-score, confusion matrix)
5. **Generate dialect predictions** (test on new samples)

## Dataset

**Multi-Modal Dialect Corpus**
- Languages: English (US/UK/Australian regional varieties)
- Modalities: Speech audio + text transcriptions
- Dialects: 8-10 regional varieties per language
- Features: Phonetic, lexical, syntactic markers
- Size: ~1.5GB (audio + text)
- Source: Public dialect corpora (IDEA, Speech Accent Archive)

## Colab Considerations

This notebook works on Colab but you'll notice:
- **20-minute download** at session start (no persistence)
- **60-75 minute training** (close to timeout limit)
- **Re-download required** if session disconnects
- **~11GB RAM usage** (near Colab's limit)

These limitations become important for real research workflows.

## What's Included

- Single Jupyter notebook (`dialect-classification.ipynb`)
- Dialect corpus access utilities
- Transformer architecture for classification
- Training and evaluation pipeline
- Prediction interface for new samples

## Key Methods

- **Transformer models:** BERT/RoBERTa for text, Wav2Vec2 for audio
- **Multi-modal learning:** Combine acoustic and textual features
- **Transfer learning:** Fine-tune pre-trained language models
- **Feature extraction:** Phonetic, lexical, syntactic patterns
- **Sociolinguistic analysis:** Regional variation patterns

## Next Steps

**Experiencing limitations?** This project pushes Colab to its limits:

- **Tier 1:** [Multi-language dialectology ensemble](../tier-1/) on Studio Lab
  - Cache 10GB of data (download once, use forever)
  - Train ensemble models (5-6 hours continuous)
  - Persistent environments and checkpoints
  - No session timeouts

- **Tier 2:** [AWS-integrated workflows](../tier-2/) with S3 and SageMaker
  - Store 100GB+ speech corpora on S3
  - Distributed preprocessing with Lambda
  - Managed training jobs

- **Tier 3:** [Production-scale analysis](../tier-3/) with full CloudFormation
  - 50+ languages and dialects (5TB+)
  - Distributed acoustic processing
  - Real-time dialect identification API

## Requirements

Pre-installed in Colab and Studio Lab:
- Python 3.9+, PyTorch/TensorFlow
- transformers, librosa, soundfile
- scikit-learn, scipy
- pandas, numpy

**Note:** First run downloads 1.5GB of data (15-20 minutes)
